## Space Curves
The code *spacecurve.m* takes as input the parametric equations for a vector function, then animates the curve through all values of the parameter. Optional inputs are the values of the parameter and the frame rate. When the code is finished running it produces the animation as a gif *spacecurve.gif*.

## Curvature
The code *anicurvature.m* takes as input the parametric equations for a vector function, then animates the circle of curvature and the tangent, normal, and binormal vectors as the curve is traversed. Optional input is the range of parameter values. When the code is finished running it produces the animation as a gif *anicurvature.gif*. The code *viscurvature.m* draws the circle of curvature and the tangent, normal, and binormal vectors at a fixed point along the curve.

## Archytas Curve
Contains a story in addition to animations of the Archytas space curve. Archytas (born 427 BC) was an ancient Greek philosopher, mathematician, and king.
