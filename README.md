# Multivarable Calculus
Here I provide demonstrations and the code I used in my multivariable calculus course I taught during the summer 2023 at the University of Cincinnati.
I also include here some special topics I covered during the course, such as the story of the Archytas curve in ancient Greece.

## Vectors, Dot and Cross Products, Equations of Lines, Planes, and Surfaces

The content here is contained in the 'Vectors_Planes_Surfaces' folder, roughly covering chapter 12 of Stewart's *Early Transcendentals* and chapter 1 of Milavcic's *Illustrative Guide to Multivariable Calculus*. The highlights are visualizing vector operations and surfaces generated by conic sections (quadric surfaces).

## Vector-valued functions, Space Curves, Brief Vector Calculus, Arclength and Curvature

The content here is contained in the 'Curvature_VectorFunctions' folder. covering 13.1-13.3 of Stewart's *Early Transcendentals*. The highlights are animations for space curves and animating the circle of curvature, and the normal and tangent vectors as the curve is traversed in time. Included is a special project on the Archytas curve.

## Functions of Several Variables, Partial Derivatives, The Gradient
