# Multivarable Calculus
Here I provide demonstrations and the code I used in my multivariable calculus course I taught during the summer 2023 at the University of Cincinnati.
I also include here some special topics I covered during the course, such as the story of the Archytas curve in ancient Greece.

## Vectors, Dot and Cross Products, Equations of Lines, Planes, and Surfaces

## Vector-valued functions, Space Curves, Brief Vector Calculus, Arclength and Curvature

## Functions of Several Variables, Partial Derivatives, The Gradient
